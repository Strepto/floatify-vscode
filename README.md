# Floatify

Floatify is a VSCode extension for converting all non-specified floating point numbers (doubles) in a C# file to floats on save. That is: We convert every `1.0` to `1.0f` on save.

This is useful when programming games in engines such as Unity, where most floating point math is done with float32 instead of doubles (float64) which is the default floating point type in C#. Other C# game engines also use float(32) for most calculations, and having to write the f suffix on every number manually is slow and obtrusive.

Do note: this extension may have some severe bugs. Please do not hesitate to suggest improvements in a GitHub issue.

## Features

NOTE: Read [Requirements](#requirements) below for how to enable the plugin.

On save converts all non-specified floating point numbers to floats instead of the default double.

Before saving:

```cs
var floaing = 1000.01; 
var floatMe = 1.0; 
var int_ = 1; 
var double_ = 1000.0d; 
var money_ = 1000.0m; 
var text = "100.0";
var vec = new Vector3(1.23, 14.3, 10.9);
var math = 1.0 + 13.0 + 44.0 * 1.4 * 1;
```

// After save:

```cs
var floaing = 1000.01f; // Floated
var floatMe = 1.0f; // Converted to float
var int_ = 1; // Kept as int
var double_ = 1000.0d; // Kept as double
var money_ = 1000.0m; // Kept as money
var text = "100.0"; // Unchanged (somewhat understands strings)
var vec = new Vector3(1.23f, 14.3f, 10.9f); // Converted to floats
var math = 1.0f + 13.0f + 44.0f * 1.4f * 1; // Converted to floats except where its an int
```

This will auto-fix `"Cannot convert from 'double' to 'float'"` (`CS1503`) on save ðŸ’¾.

To use doubles just add the `d` suffix instead of `f`. Example: `1.0d` is not modified on save, but `1.0` is modified to `1.0f`.

## Requirements

As this is a very intrusive and breaking extension for projects that are not using floats as the default we require a floatify.json file in any parent folder to the current script you are editing for this extension to have any effect. If this files contains the below .json the extension is enabled on save.

NOTE: If this file does not exist this extension does NOTHING.

```json
// floatify.json
{
    "enabled": true
}
```

YOU ALSO need to enable code-actions on save by adding this to your `/.vscode/setting.json` file.

```json
{
    // -snip
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": "explicit"
    },
    // -snip
}
```

## Known Issues

This has problems identifying if numbers are inside strings.
